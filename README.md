## 🎨 Flavorful themes for [Kuro](https://github.com/davidsmorais/kuro)

This port brings the soothing Catppuccin color palette to Kuro, with full support for all four official flavors:

- 🌑 Mocha
- 🧊 Frappe
- 🍵 Macchiato
- 🌤️ Latte

Each file in `themes/` is carefully tuned to match Catppuccin’s aesthetic and works beautifully with Kuro's modern interface.
